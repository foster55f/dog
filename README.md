# DogParty

This project was focused on writing well structured HTML with clean CSS.  The process of creating a 1 page static page to match a comp was done to better enhance my skills as a front end developer.  The task of creating 2 css stylesheets with one HTML structure was done to show how to incorporate different styles within a single HTML code.  I was able to add a bit of javascript to enhance this site. 

Here are the comps I needed for project:
